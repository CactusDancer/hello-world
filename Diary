I annouced on Twitter and Facebook that I would do this.  
I joined lastpass then updated my facebook main email and password.  Password in lastpass vault.
I joined github.  Password in lastpass.

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request
